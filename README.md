# **Mental Distress and Well-Being Across the U.S.** ðŸŒŽðŸ§   

## **Overview**  
Mental health is a growing concern in the U.S., influenced by socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic factors. This project leverages **data visualization and statistical analysis** to explore **mental distress trends**, identify **correlations with crime and income levels**, and uncover **insights across demographics**.  

By integrating datasets from the **CDC, FBI, and World Population Review**, this project provides a **comprehensive view of mental distress patterns** and their impact on well-being across the U.S.  

## **Key Research Questions**  
- ðŸ“Œ **Which states exhibit higher mental distress rates?**  
- ðŸ“Œ **How does mental distress vary by age, gender, and ethnicity?**  
- ðŸ“Œ **Is there a correlation between violent crime rates and mental distress?**  
- ðŸ“Œ **Does income level impact mental distress rates?**  
- ðŸ“Œ **How has mental distress trended over the years?**  

## **Methodology**  
### **Data Sources**  
- **[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alzheimers-disease-and-healthy-aging-data)** â€“ Mental distress statistics  
- **[Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-5)** â€“ State-wise violent crime rates  
- **[World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/crime-rate-by-state)** â€“ Updated crime rate data  

### **Data Processing Steps**  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, removing duplicates  
2. **Data Normalization:** Standardizing income levels and crime rates  
3. **Merging Datasets:** Integrating multiple data sources for comparative analysis  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends and patterns  
5. **Visualization:** Creating **heatmaps, trend graphs, correlation plots**, and demographic comparisons  

## **Visual Analysis & Key Insights**  
âœ” **Geographic Disparities:**  
   - West Virginia (15.5%) and Oklahoma (14.3%) show higher distress rates.  
   - North Dakota (7.4%) and South Dakota (7.6%) have lower distress rates.  

âœ” **Rising Mental Distress:**  
   - Mental distress rates increased from **10.3% (2015) to 11.8% (2022)**, with a **notable surge during COVID-19**.  

âœ” **Demographics Impact:**  
   - **Middle-aged adults (50-64)** report the highest distress at **12.9%**.  
   - **Women (12.1%)** report higher distress compared to **men (8.6%)**.  
   - **Native American communities (18.5%)** have the highest distress among ethnic groups.  

âœ” **Crime & Income Correlation:**  
   - **States with higher violent crime rates also report higher mental distress.**  
   - **Lower median income correlates with increased distress levels.**  

## **Recommendations & Implementation**  
âœ… **Policy Interventions:** Increased mental health funding in high-distress states  
âœ… **Community Safety Initiatives:** Reducing crime to lower stress-related distress  
âœ… **Economic Support Programs:** Addressing financial struggles linked to mental distress  
âœ… **Long-Term Monitoring:** Continuous data collection to track trends
